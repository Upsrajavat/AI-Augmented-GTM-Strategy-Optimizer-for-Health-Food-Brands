AI-Augmented GTM Strategy Optimizer for Health-Food Brands
A Business Intelligence project using Power BI + GPT-4 to help health-food brands like YogaBar identify product gaps, optimize ad budgets, and generate AI-powered insights from customer reviews.

🚀 Project Summary
This is a self-initiated, end-to-end Power BI project built to solve real problems faced by modern D2C food brands. It combines data analysis, business logic, and artificial intelligence to help Product and Marketing teams make smarter decisions.

🎯 Problem Statement
Health-food companies often struggle with:
